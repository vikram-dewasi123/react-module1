Answer 1 =>  JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
             JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
             JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

             JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
             It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, often used with React to describe what the UI should look like. 
             With JSX, you can write HTML structures in the same file as your JavaScript code, creating a seamless development experience.


 Answer 2 =>  JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML - like code within JavaScript.
             It introduces XML - like tags and attributes to create React elements.JS, on the other hand,
             is plain JavaScript code without any special syntax or extensions.
             


 Answer 3 =>  Curly braces in JSX are the syntactic sugar that sweetens the development process. 
            The indicators tell React to interpret the enclosed content as JavaScript, not plain text. 
            This allows developers to embed variables, function calls, and other JavaScript expressions directly within their JSX code. 
            
            In JSX, anything inside curly braces is evaluated as a JavaScript expression.
            This means you can perform operations, access variables, and execute functions right within your JSX.
            It's a powerful feature that enables developers to create dynamic and responsive UIs.
